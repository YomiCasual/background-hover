					<h2>Beautiful Sky</h2>
					<p>In this life I've known nothing but seeds you've sown
I've walked the highways and I've combed the side roads
It's been a joy of highs, oh the pain of lows
I met the Devil at the heart of the crossroads
I share a soul with a hunting hound
My blood's a red river that flows through every town
No
Have you ever felt like I have?

					<h2>Persistence</h2>
					<p>This world is overflowing with people who gave up on their desires, dreams and goals at the first sign of opposition. To achieve our dreams and desires, we need to be persistent. Napoleon Hill of “Think and Grow Rich” fame wrote “The majority of men meet with failure because of their lack of persistence in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail.”</p>

					<h2>Sea Beauty</h2>
					<p>I am standing upon the seashore.
A ship at my side spreads her white
sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean.
 

She is an object of beauty and strength.
I stand and watch her until at length
she hangs like a speck of white cloud
just where the sea and sky come
to mingle with each other. </p>

					<h2>Memories</h2>
					<p>I am in the lake, in the center
of the picture, just under the surface.

It is difficult to say where
precisely, or to say
how large or how small I am:
the effect of water
on light is a distortion.

but if you look long enough
eventually
you will see me</p>
